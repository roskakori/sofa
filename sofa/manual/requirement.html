<h1>Requirements</h1>


<ul>

<li>A C compiler. SmallEiffel does not generate machine code directly,
rather than intermediate C code.

<li>AmigaOS 3.x. Older versions like 2.04 might work, but haven't been
tested.

<li>MC 68020. The compiler and its tools have been compiled for this
CPU because they get quite a lot smaller and faster than if compiled
for plain 68000. But of course, the executables the compiler generates
work with whatever CPU you specify.

<li>About 4 MB RAM and 30 MB hard-disk space. This should be
sufficient to compile most realistic projects. More is better, less
might work but don't count on it. Because the SmallEiffel compiler
doesn't yet handle out of memory errors, watch your Workbench title
bar if you are short of RAM. (This bug has already been reported and
is probably fixed in later releases).

<li>If you want to recompile SmallEiffel yourself, you need about 20MB
RAM and a lot of harddisk space.</li>

</ul>
