<h1>C Compiler</h1>


<p>As already stated, SmallEiffel needs a C compiler to create an
executable program. The reason for that is portability: a C compiler
and standard library exists for almost every platform still in use -
even Amiga(!).</p>

<p>Sofa supports several Amiga C compilers, with some of them being
Freeware:</p>

<ul>

<li>SAS/c was the commercial compiler used for the development of
AmigaOS itself. It is also the compiler of choice for the binaries
included in the Sofa distribution. If you already own SAS/c, use it
for Sofa. Unfortunately it has sold out, so you can't get a new copy
anywhere.

<li>Dice also was commercial some time ago. But when the original
author abandoned the project, he released the source code to the
public and declared it freeware. Soon after that, Dice was under
active maintenance again. It is relatively easy to install, very small
and really faaast. If you don't have a C compiler, and want to use it
only for Sofa, Dice is probably your best bet. You can obtain it from
<a
href="http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/~aminet/dirs/aminet/dev/c/">aminet:dev/c/dice*.lha</a>.
There is also a home page and a mailing list. Refer to the Dice manual
for details.

<li>Vbcc is a relatively new, and also free.
It has been designed with portability in mind from the beginning, and also
supports PPC.
You can download it from <a
href="http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/~aminet/dirs/aminet/dev/c/">aminet:dev/c/vbcc*.lha</a>.

<li>GNU CC (gcc) is a highly portable compiler package closely related
to the Unix world. Unless you already have some experience with it,
you probably don't want to use it. You can obtain the Amiga version
from the <a href="http://www.ninemoons.com/gg/">Geek Gadgets</a>
project.

</ul>
