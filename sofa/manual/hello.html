<h1>First Steps</h1>


<h2>Hello.e</h2>

<p>Once Sofa is installed and you have rebooted (to enable the new
Workbench search path), start your editor and create a file
<tt>hello.e</tt> with the following content:

<pre>
class HELLO

creation make

feature
   make is
   do
      print("hello.%N")
   end

end -- class HELLO
</pre>

<p>To compile it, open a CLI and type</p>

<pre>
compile hello
</pre>

<p>Then you might have to wait for quite some while. Eventually, you
should end up with a program <tt>hello</tt> that, when invoked,
displays the text "<tt>hello.</tt>".</p>

<p>If not, request <a href="support.html">support</a>.</p>

<p>If so, congratulations, you just created a debugging version of
<tt>hello</tt>. To get rid of all the junk files the compiler created,
type</p>

<pre>
clean hello
</pre>

<p>To create an optimised version without the garbage collector (GC),
type</p>

<pre>
compile -boost -no_gc hello
</pre>

<p>This reduces the size of the executable from about 50K to about
14K, which should be quite acceptable. I mention this just because
early Eiffel compilers created 2MB <tt>hello</tt> programs, and some
people still have this misconception in their mind.</p>

<h2>What next?</h2>

<p>You can find some more plain Eiffel examples in the
<tt>sofa:SmallEiffel/lib_show</tt> directory. For Amiga specific
stuff, take a look at the <a href="../library/sofa/welcome.html">sofa
library</a>.</p>

<p>If you take a look at the <a href="faq.html">questions &amp;
answers</a> section, you will find lots of interesting pointers and
solutions to common problems.</p>
