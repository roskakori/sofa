<h1>Installation</h1>


<p>After you made your choice about the C compiler, and possible
installed one, use the included installer script to finally get
started with Eiffel. The script already creates all internal
configurations files. So don't perform a manual installation, unless
you need an ego rush and want to read a huge pile of
documentation.</p>
