<h1>History</h1>



(First entry refers to current version, older versions see below.)

<h2>Version 1.1, 10-Apr-2000</h2>

<ul>

<li>Added <a href="c_compiler.html">C compiler</a> support for Dice
and Vbcc; both are available from Aminet.

<li>Added <a href="../library/sofa/welcome.html">sofa library</a> for
some basic AmigaOS stuff: inter process communication (ARexx), command
line parsing (ReadArgs), pattern matching (MatchPattern)...

<li>Updated to SmallEiffel -0.76b1.

<li>Changed archive so that it does not anymore contain sub-archives
that are extracted during installation.

<li>Improved installation: checks system and environment for
requirements, and reports about problems; uses SmallEiffel's internal
"install.e" to setup the compiler, class loadpath etc; some messages
and help texts should be more clear now.

<li>Removed compile_to_jvm because there is no useful JVM for AmigaOS
anyway.

</ul>


<h2>Version 1.0, 12-Oct-1999</h2>

<ul>

<li>First public release

</ul>
