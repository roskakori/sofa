<h1>History</h1>



(First entry refers to current version, older versions see below.)

<h2>Version 1.2, 14-Nov-2000</h2>

<ul>

<li>Fixed bug in <a href="../library/sofa/example/make_rename_se/welcome.html">make_rename_se</a> that could cause creation of empty rename.se

<li>Fixed bug in installer: when installing sofa for the first time,
the installer warned about not enough disk space available even if
there was (because it tried to check the space of the none-existent
target directory, and thus thought 0 MB are free).

<li>Updated to SmallEiffel -0.76

<li>Updated to Gobo 1.6

<li>Improved installation: if an existing Sofa is encountered in
the target directory, it offers to backup or remove the old version.

<li>Added <a
href="../SmallEiffel/man/compile_to_jvm.html">compile_to_jvm</a> binary and
some notes on <a href="faq.html#java">Java on Amiga</a>.

</ul>

<h2>Version 1.1, 10-Apr-2000</h2>

<ul>

<li>Added <a href="c_compiler.html">C compiler</a> support for Dice
and Vbcc; both are available from Aminet.

<li>Added <a href="../library/sofa/welcome.html">sofa library</a> for
some basic AmigaOS stuff: inter process communication (ARexx), command
line parsing (ReadArgs), pattern matching (MatchPattern)...

<li>Updated to SmallEiffel -0.76b1.

<li>Changed archive so that it does not anymore contain sub-archives
that are extracted during installation.

<li>Improved installation: checks system and environment for
requirements, and reports about problems; uses SmallEiffel's internal
"install.e" to setup the compiler, class loadpath etc; some messages
and help texts should be more clear now.

<li>Removed compile_to_jvm because there is no useful JVM for AmigaOS
anyway.

</ul>


<h2>Version 1.0, 12-Oct-1999</h2>

<ul>

<li>First public release

</ul>
