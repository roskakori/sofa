<h1>To Do</h1>


<p>As this is a quite early version of Sofa, there's a lot of things
to do:</p>

<ul>

<li>Because I added most of the manual quite recently, there are
probably a lot of typos, inconsistencies, repetitions and sentences
that simply don't make sense.

<li>PPC support. Basically, only a recompile with the PPC version
of SAS/c or Vbcc should do the trick. However, as there are no
PPC-Sofa users, so nobody could test this yet.

<li>Many things are too SAS/c focused right now (Makefiles, link
libraries). This might cause problems with other compilers. On the
long run, there should be general tools like <tt>c_compile</tt> and
<tt>make_library</tt> that analyze the SmallEiffel settings and use
the appropriate tools and options.

<li>Improve documentation. Though most things should be documented to
some extent, it's probably a bit terse, especially for beginners. Some
more hints about C compilers could also help. Navigation features
suck.

<li>Near future for sofa library should bring file information, exec
message ports, resource tracking from the Eiffel side (not only C)
etc.

<li>Far future for sofa library could bring a notification framework
that could also work as a base for a possible GUI (similar to ISE's
WEL)

</ul>
