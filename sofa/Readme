DESCRIPTION

  Sofa is the Amiga distribution of SmallEiffel, the GNU Eiffel
  compiler. It also includes some goodies like the Gobo data
  structures library, parser generator tools and Amiga-related
  libraries for ARexx, argument parsing and pattern matching.

  Eiffel is an advanced, yet simple and easy to learn, object-oriented
  programming language that emphasizes the design and construction of
  high-quality and reusable software. Interfaces to other languages
  such as ARexx, C and C++ are supported.

FEATURES

  - supports incremental compilation
  - compiles to C code or Java byte code
  - generated executables run about as fast as their C/C++ equivalents
  - interfaces to ARexx, C and C++
  - includes Sofa Library to access Amiga features
  - does *not* require ixemul.library

NEW FEATURES

  - includes current version of SmallEiffel and Gobo
  - some minor fixes and improvements

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  - a C compiler (SAS/c, Dice or Vbcc) or Java byte code interpreter
  - AmigaOS 3.x
  - 68020
  - 4MB free RAM
  - 30MB free harddisk space

INSTALLATION

  Use the included Amiga Installer script. Sofa does not require any
  manual fiddling with environment variables or the user-startup.

  The archive extracts to a directory called "sofa". If you already
  extract it to the location where you want Sofa to reside, the
  installation will be much faster because the copying can be skipped.
