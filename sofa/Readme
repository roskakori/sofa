DESCRIPTION

  Sofa is the Amiga distribution of SmallEiffel, the GNU Eiffel
  compiler. It also includes the Gobo data structures library and
  parser generator tools.

  Eiffel is an advanced object-oriented programming language that
  emphasizes the design and construction of high-quality and reusable
  software. It supports the concept of "Design by Contract" to improve
  software correctness, allowing a program to validate its consistency
  during run time. Interfaces to other languages such as C and C++ are
  supported.

  Eiffel's design addresses many practical concerns that software
  engineers face when creating complex software. It has an elegant
  design and programming style, and is easy to learn.
