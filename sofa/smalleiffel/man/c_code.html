People who want or have to code part of their applications and/or libraries in C
should really limit themselves to the clean interfaces provided by
<A HREF="cecil.html">Cecil</A> or the <A HREF="external.html">external</A>
mechanism. This page mentions some facts you should be aware of before you start.

First and above all, SmallEiffel generates one unique type name in the C code for each
living type present in the Eiffel code. This type is of the form <TT>Txyz</TT> where
<TT>xyz</TT> represents the number corresponding to the name of the type,
including its parameters in the case of generic types. (More details about this in our
<A HREF="http://SmallEiffel.loria.fr/papers/papers.html">research papers</A>). When you compile your application,
you can find them in a mangling table, somewhere in the C code, which looks like this:
</P>
<PRE>
D 2  T1489 R BOOLEAN_CONSTANT 210,253
A 1  T945  R BIT_CONSTANT 945
A*1  T218  R TAG_NAME 218
A 1  T602  R TYPE_BIT_1 602
</PRE>
<P>
But don't use this information ! The mangling table is only valid for
one specific compilation of one specific application with one specific
compiler and specific libraries...
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when computing a type code, collisions may occur, and affect this process.
Thus, the number (and name) corresponding to each type depends not only on the type
name, but also on the order in which they are compiled. That is, on the application
and libraries compiled... They also depend on the compilation mode used, and
the version of the compiler you're using. So what is <TT>T145</TT> now may
become <TT>T234</TT> the next time you compile...
</P>
<P>
Consequently, <B>do not, ever, rely on the type numbers  in the
generated C code, because they are not constant !</B> (Except for a few ones
which have a fixed, hard-coded name). So don't bother writing in your own C code
things such as <TT>new123</TT> or <TT>T456</TT>, because the only thing we guarantee
in this case is that your code shall break one day or another...
</P>

OK, so now you understand why you cannot use type numbers, but you
still want
to know what those things in the mangling table mean. :)
</P>
<P>
First, a big caveat. Although it hasn't changed a lot
and has been very stable for quite some time now, <B> the mangling table coding
may change </B> in the future ! As I'm writing these lines, we have no
plans to change it, and we prefer keeping it the way it is. But once
again, we do not commit ourselves to the current representation.
</P>

Here is excerpts of a mangling table which cover all the possible
cases (taken from some <TT>compile_to_c.h</TT>):
<PRE>
A 1  T220  R E_DEBUG 220
A 6  T326  R FIXED_ARRAY[RUN_FEATURE] 389,384,367,352,326,53
D 2  T166  R BOOLEAN_CONSTANT 169,168
A*1  T215  R E_ENSURE 215
A 1  T37   E NATIVE_ARRAY[STRING] 37
</PRE>

Each mangling table entry comprises 7 fields:

<DL>

<DT><EM>Liveness</EM></DT>
<DD>The first field shows whether the type is
<B>D</B>ead or (<B>A</B>)Live, that is whether instances of this type
are ever created at run-time. <SMALL>(Ok, it should have been L, instead of
A...)</SMALL></DD>

<DT><EM>Tagless</EM></DT>
<DD>When the second character on a line is a star <TT><B>*</B></TT>, it marks
an untagged type, that is a type on which there is no late binding
but only static calls. Note that the type inference algorithm used in
SmallEiffel increases the number of such types.</DD>

<DT><EM># of live subtypes</EM></DT>
<DD>Number of concrete, live descendants of the
type (including itself). It is thus the number of items in the last field.
</DD>

<DT><EM>Type mangled name</EM></DD>
<DD>The type name in the C code.
As <A HREF="c_code.html#generated-type-ids">explained
above</A>, the ID number varies.</DD>


<DT><EM>Reference</EM><DT>
<DD>Is the type a <B>R</B>eference or an <B>E</B>xpanded one?</DD>

<DT><EM>Full type name</EM></DT>
<DD>Self-explanatory...</DD>

<DT><EM>Live subtypes list</EM></DT>
<DD>A comma-separated list of type IDs listing all the live
descendants of the current type (including itself, if it is a live one).
</DD>
