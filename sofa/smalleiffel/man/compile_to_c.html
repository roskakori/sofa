</TT>
</P><P>
Command <TT>compile_to_c</TT> is the SmallEiffel ANSI C code generator.
Usualy this command is automatically called by command
<A HREF="compile.html"><TT>compile</TT></A>
but you can use it separately to produce C code.
</P><P>
Command <TT>compile_to_c</TT> must have at least one argument to indicate
the starting execution point of the system.
Thus your program will start in <I>&lt;Root-Procedure&gt;</I> of <I>&lt;Root-Class&gt;</I>.
The default <I>&lt;Root-Procedure&gt;</I> is <I>make</I>.
</P><P>
Command <TT>compile_to_c</TT> produces all the required C files as well as a script file. The name of this script file changes with
the operating system used (*.make on Unix or *.BAT on DOS for
example).

</TABLE>
<P>
There are 8 modes of compilation given by the following
options names: <I>-debug_check -all_check -loop_check -invariant_check
-ensure_check -require_check -no_check</I> and <I>-boost option</I>.
Only one mode can be selected for the whole system to compile.
Mode <I>-all_check</I> is the default one.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<I>-boost</I>:<BR><DD>
Compilation mode with the highest degree of optimization.
<BR>
   There is
   no target's existence test, no system-level validity checking.
   Some routines are inlined. No code is generated to get an execution
   trace in case of failure. No assertion is checked.
<BR><BR>
<DT>
<I>-no_check</I>:<BR><DD>
Compilation mode in which no Eiffel assertion is checked.
<BR>
   The target's existence test is performed. Some code is generated
   for the system-level validity checking, and to produce an execution
   trace (an execution stack is managed).
<BR>
   There is no inlining and no assertion check.
<BR><BR>
<DT>
<I>-require_check</I>:<BR><DD>
Compilation mode in which Eiffel preconditions
   are checked.
<BR>
The generated code is similar to the previous one,
   but also includes code to test preconditions (require).
<BR><BR>
<DT>
<I>-ensure_check</I>:<BR><DD>
The generated code is similar to the previous one,
   but also includes code to test postconditions (ensure).
<BR><BR>
<DT>
<I>-invariant_check</I>:<BR><DD>
The generated code is similar to the previous one,
   but also includes code to test class invariants.
<BR><BR>
<DT>
<I>-loop_check</I>:<BR><DD>
The generated code is similar to the previous one,
   but also includes code to test loop variants and loop invariants.
<BR><BR>
<DT>
<I>-all_check</I>:<BR><DD>
The default mode. The generated code is similar to the
   previous one, but also includes code for the check instruction.
<BR><BR>
<DT>
<I>-debug_check</I>:<BR><DD>
The generated code is similar to the previous one,
   but also includes code for debug instructions.
   All debugs are checked regardless of the optional string key.

<DL COMPACT>


<DT>
<I>-verbose</I>:<BR><DD>
 Print system information during the compilation (full path of
   loaded files, type inference score, removed files, etc.).
<BR><BR>

<DT>
<I>-version</I>:<BR><DD>
Show the number of the <A HREF="SmallEiffelFAQ.html#Q02">version of SmallEiffel</A>
you're using.
<BR><BR>

<DT>
<I>-cc &lt;c_compiler&gt;</I>:<BR><DD>
Call <I>&lt;c_compiler&gt;</I> instead of the default C compiler.
   See the <TT>READ_ME</TT> file of directory <TT>sys</TT> to set the
   default C compiler as well as the default linker.
<BR><BR>

<DT>
<I>-no_gc</I>:<BR><DD>
No Garbage Collector.
<BR>
When this option is selected, no GC is produced
and (at least) one actual malloc is perform for each object creation.
This option is useful when one prefers to use another GC provided
by an external library (such as the Boehm-Demers-Weiser
conservative GC), or when no GC is needed.
Whithout flag <I>-no_gc</I>, SmallEiffel computes a customized GC for
each system.
<BR>
It is important to rememeber that some architecture-dependent code may be
required for the proper operation of the GC (see
file <TT>SmallEiffel/sys/gc</TT> for details).
<BR><BR>

<DT>
<I>-no_split</I>:<BR><DD>
 Produce only one C file for the whole Eiffel system.
<BR>
   This may enable the C compiler to inline more functions calls. This option
   is useful only to finalize an application (the incremental C
   compiling mode is switched off with <I>-no_split</I>).
<BR><BR>

<DT>
<I>-no_strip</I>:<BR><DD>
 Do not remove symbol information from the generated executable file.
<BR>
  This option is useful only when finalizing an application
<BR><BR>

<DT>
<I>-o &lt;output_name&gt;</I>:<BR><DD>
 Name the executable file <TT>output_name</TT>.
<BR>
This has the same meaning as the <I>-o option</I> of many C compilers.
<BR><BR>

<DT>
<I>-cecil &lt;cecil_file&gt;</I>:<BR><DD>
 Allow some Eiffel features to be called
   from C (see the
   <A HREF="cecil.html"><code>cecil</code></A>
   file for details). To call C functions/macros
   from Eiffel see the
   <A HREF="external.html"><code>external</code></A>
   file.
<BR><BR>

<DT>
<I>-no_main</I>:<BR><DD>
 Avoid generation of the C main function: thus, the root procedure is not
 started. This is useful when one prefers to start execution from outside
 before calling Eiffel routines via the cecil interface.
 Before calling the first Eiffel routine one has to call once a predefined
 C function in order to initialize internal runtime information for the
 Eiffel world (see example
 in directory SmallEiffel/lib_show/cecil/example7 for details).
<BR><BR>

<DT>
<I>-no_style_warning</I>:<BR><DD>
Suppress output for warning messages related to non respect of standard Eiffel
style guidelines (for example <CODE>ItEm</CODE> will not trigger a warning).
<BR><BR>


<DT>
<I>-case_insensitive</I>:<BR><DD>
Switch case insensitive mode on.
<BR>
For example,
when this mode is selected, the Eiffel parser considers that the
following identifiers refer to the same feature: <CODE>item</CODE>, <CODE>ITEM</CODE>,
<CODE>ItEm</CODE>, ...
<BR><BR>

<DT>
<I>-no_warning</I>:<BR><DD>
Suppress output for all warning messages (error messages
are still printed).
<BR><BR>


<DT>
<A NAME="trace"><I>-trace</I>:<BR><DD></A>
This option may be useful to debug your program or to realize
   some profiling.
<BR>
When selected, this option allows the user either to generate
   a "trace.se" file at execution time, or to enter the interactive
   debugger.
<UL>
<LI>
When one interactively chooses the generation of the trace
   file, a (usually huge) file "trace.se" is created in the
   launching directory which shows the code the program is executing:
   which line, which column, in which Eiffel source file. Because all
   classes are traced, "trace.se" is a huge file even for a small program.
<BR>
   Feature <I>GENERAL.trace_switch</I> allows to dynamically turn on/off
   trace generation. At run time, when argument of <I>trace_switch</I> is
   true, trace printing is switched on (conversely, false is to switch
   off trace printing). When option <I>-trace</I> is not selected, calls to
   <I>trace_switch</I> are not taken in account by
   <TT>compile_to_c</TT> (no C code is produced). The <I>-trace</I> mode
   is not available with mode <I>-boost</I>.
   Using at the same time <I>-trace</I> with <I>-boost</I> as the
   same effect as using <I>-trace</I> with <I>-no_check</I>. Also keep
   in mind that very simple
   instructions (as for example "i := i + 1;") may not be traced.
</LI>
<LI>
When the interactive debugger is chosen, the user enters a gdb like
   interface. Please note that currently just an embryo of debugger is
   implemented. It is only possible to display the execution stack
   and step into the code.
<BR>
   Command <TT>?</TT> displays a short help message.
