<TT>install [-interactive] [-debug]</TT>
</P><P>
Command <TT>install</TT> is the installation program for SmallEiffel
The GNU Eiffel Compiler.
<BR>
This command (class <TT>install.e</TT>) is entirely written in Eiffel
and is the recommanded one to install SmallEiffel The GNU Eiffel Compiler.
</P><P>
The <TT>install.e</TT> source code as well as the generated C code
<TT>install.c</TT> are in the SmallEiffel directory.

</P><P>
If you are under some <B>UNIX</B> (including GNU Linux) system and if you want
to use the <TT>gcc</TT> compiler like we do, simply type <TT>make</TT>
in the SmallEiffel directory (the <TT>Makefile</TT> which is in the
SmallEiffel directory C-compile and launch automatically the
<TT>install</TT> command).

</P><P>
If you are using a <B>Windows</B> system, a precompiled <TT>install.exe</TT>
is available too in the SmallEiffel directory, you just have to run it.
</P><P>
On <B>other systems</B>, the very first step for installation is to C compile
the <TT>install.c</TT> file in order to run it.

<I>-interactive</I>:<BR>
<DD> By default, the <TT>install</TT> command tries to determinate
	automatically the system name as well as the C compiler name.
	When the flag <I>-interactive</I> is used, the user is interactively
	prompted for the system name and the C compiler to select.
<BR><BR>
<DT>

<I>-debug</I>:<BR>
<DD>
Displays a lot of information useful to debug the installation
process.
It is also interresting if you are curious to see what the
<TT>install</TT> command is really doing (or trying to do ;) ).

<dt><i>-no_compile</i>:
<dd>Assumes that all commands are already compiled and their executables
	 exist. This is useful only for binary distributions.

<dt><i>-compiler name</i>:
<dd>By default, <tt>install</tt> interactively asks for the C compiler to use.
	 With this option specified, is skips this query and uses the C compiler <i>name</i>.
	 <i>Name</i> must be one of the available compilers (e.g. <tt>gcc</tt>).
	 This is mostly useful for system-specific installation scripts that
	 execute <tt>install</tt> as part of it.
