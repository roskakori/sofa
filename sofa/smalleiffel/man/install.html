<TT>install [-interactive] [-debug] [-cc &lt;c_compiler&gt;] [-skip_c_compilation]</TT>
</P><P>
Command <TT>install</TT> is the installation program for SmallEiffel
The GNU Eiffel Compiler.
<BR>
This command (class <TT>install.e</TT>) is entirely written in Eiffel
and is the recommanded one to install SmallEiffel The GNU Eiffel Compiler.
</P><P>
The <TT>install.e</TT> source code as well as the generated C code
<TT>install.c</TT> are in the SmallEiffel directory.

</P><P>
If you are under some <B>UNIX</B> (including GNU Linux) system and if you want
to use the <TT>gcc</TT> compiler like we do, simply type <TT>make</TT>
in the SmallEiffel directory. The <TT>Makefile</TT> which is in the
SmallEiffel directory C-compile and launch automatically the
<TT>install</TT> command.
Furthermore, if you want to select manually the C compiler to be used,
you should consider to type <TT>make interactive</TT> (this will
add the <I>-interactive</I> flag described below).

</P><P>
If you are using a <B>Windows</B> system, a precompiled <TT>install.exe</TT>
is available too in the SmallEiffel directory, you just have to run it.
</P><P>
On <B>other systems</B>, the very first step for installation is to C compile
the <TT>install.c</TT> file in order to run it.

</P>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><I>-interactive</I>:<BR>
<DD> By default, the <TT>install</TT> command tries to determinate
automatically the system name as well as the C compiler name.
When the flag <I>-interactive</I> is used, the user is interactively
prompted for the system name and the C compiler to select as well
as some other crucial informations.
When all the information has been interactively gathered, the command
prompts for confirmation before starting the remainder of the
installation process automatically.
Using first the <I>-interactive</I> flag is a good idea to know more
about supported system list as well as supported C compiler list.
<BR><BR>

<DT><I>-debug</I>:<BR><DD>
Displays a lot of information useful to debug the installation
process.
It is also interresting if you are curious to see what the
<TT>install</TT> command is really doing (or trying to do ;) ).
<BR><BR>

<DT><I>-cc &lt;c_compiler&gt;</I>:<BR><DD>
By default, <TT>install</TT> interactively asks for the C compiler
to use. With this option specified, is skips this query and uses
the <I>c_compiler</I> name. This <I>c_compiler</I> name must be one of
the supported C compilers (e.g. <TT>gcc</TT>).
This is mostly useful for system-specific installation scripts that
execute <TT>install</TT> as part of it.
<BR><BR>

<DT><I>-skip_c_compilation</I>:<BR><DD>
Assumes that all commands are already compiled and their
executables exist. This is useful only for binary distributions.
