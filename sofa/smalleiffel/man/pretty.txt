                             The pretty command

   Usage

   pretty [options] <Class_names> ...

   Command pretty is the SmallEiffel Pretty Printer for Eiffel source
   files. For all classes given as arguments, pretty looks for the
   corresponding file using the same algorithm as command finder. All the
   corresponding files are reprinted in a pretty way.

   For example, if you are allowed to write the corresponding file, you
   can reprints the source file of class HELLO_WORLD using command :
   pretty hello_world

   There are four modes of pretty printing -zen, -default, -end and
   -parano mode. Only one mode can be selected and mode -default is the
   default mode.

   Options for pretty printing

   -zen:
          The less you can print. Pseudo variable Current is never
          printed (unless it is necessary). No end mark comment for
          routines. No end comments for constructs (if, inspect, debug,
          ...). Very compact printing.
   -default:
          the default mode. Don't change printing of pseudo variable
          Current (if Current is in the input, Current is in the output).
          Print end comment of routines. Don't print end comments for
          constructs (if, inspect, debug, ...).
   -end:
          Same printing as previous mode but print ends of all constructs
          (if, inspect, debug, ...).
   -parano:
          Same printing as previous mode but prints Current everywhere
          you can.
   -no_style_warning:
          Suppress output for warning messages related to non respect of
          standard Eiffel style guidelines (for example ItEm will not
          trigger a warning).
   -no_warning:
          Suppress output for all warning messages (error messages are
          still printed).
   -version:
          Show the number of the [1]version of SmallEiffel you're using.

   Security and BackUp file

   For the security of sources files, a backup file is created before
   writting the new file (system or command pretty may crash during
   printing of the new file). The backup file name is "foo.bak" when
   source file name is "foo.e". Backup file is written in the same
   directory as source file.
   If an old backup file already exists before pretty printing, command
   pretty exit with an error message. To be sure that the pretty printing
   is well done, the output file is parsed again.
   Even if second parsing gives no errors, backup file is NOT removed.
   Thus you can recompile your Eiffel code to check new file before
   removing backup file by yourself.
