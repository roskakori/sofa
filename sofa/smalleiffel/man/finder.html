<TT>finder [options] &lt;Class&gt;</TT>
</P><P>
Command <TT>finder</TT> tells you which file is loaded when searching
for an Eiffel &lt;Class&gt;.
<BR><BR>
When an Eiffel file is found, <TT>finder</TT> prints the full path name
on standard output.
<BR><BR>
The exit status is set GENERAL.exit_success_code only when an
existing file is found (thus allowing usage of command finder
in shell scripts).
</P><P>
To see the loading path used by SmallEiffel, you can for example
type the <TT>finder</TT> command using a bad (inexistant) class name.
The default loading path may be updated (see <TT>READ_ME</TT> file of
the <TT>sys</TT> directory).
</P><P>
When invoked without any argument, the <TT>finder</TT> command
prints this help.

<A NAME="algorithm"></A>The algorithm used by SmallEiffel to look for
an Eiffel source file is the following:
</P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#a000a0"><B>1. Lower case filenames - </B></FONT>
SmallEiffel looks all along the loading path using
&lt;class&gt; name in lower case as tail. If needed, the Eiffel
suffix (".e") is added automatically. SmallEiffel only looks for
suffixed files on the disk. Only the first file encountered
according to the order of the path is taken in account.
File is always supposed to have the same name as the inside
class definition.
</P><P>
<FONT COLOR="#a000a0"><B>2. Renamed files - </B></FONT>
When the above search has failed to find a file, SmallEiffel tries
to search for files "rename.se" in all directories of the path.
<BR>
A file "rename.se" allows the user to put in file "foo" the class
"bar" for example.
<BR>
Such renaming facilities has been added especially for DOS (file
names are limited to 8 characters).
<BR>
Each line of a "rename.se" file is a renaming directive containing
two names, first the full name and then the short name to use in the
directory where the "rename.se" file is.
<BR>
File "SmallEiffel/misc/rename.se" is an example of a "rename.se" file
to put in SmallEiffel/lib_std/ for DOS.
</P><P>
Thus, knowing the algorithm of SmallEiffel to find a class file, it is
better not to use the renaming facilities to speed up class loading.
</P><P>
<FONT COLOR="#a000a0"><B>3. Upper case filenames - </B></FONT>Finally,
when both previous steps did not find the required Eiffel class file,
SmallEiffel looks along the loading path for a file bearing the class
name upper in upper case letters.
If needed, the Eiffel suffix ".e" is added automatically.
<BR>
One must note that the overhead to find an upper case file name is
not negligeable at all and that a lower case file name may hide some
upper case name.
