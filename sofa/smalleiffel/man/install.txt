                            The install command

   Usage

   install [-interactive] [-debug] [-cc <c_compiler>]
   [-skip_c_compilation]

   Command install is the installation program for SmallEiffel The GNU
   Eiffel Compiler.
   This command (class install.e) is entirely written in Eiffel and is
   the recommanded one to install SmallEiffel The GNU Eiffel Compiler.

   The install.e source code as well as the generated C code install.c
   are in the SmallEiffel directory.

   If you are under some UNIX (including GNU Linux) system and if you
   want to use the gcc compiler like we do, simply type make in the
   SmallEiffel directory. The Makefile which is in the SmallEiffel
   directory C-compile and launch automatically the install command.
   Furthermore, if you want to select manually the C compiler to be used,
   you should consider to type make interactive (this will add the
   -interactive flag described below).

   If you are using a Windows system, a precompiled install.exe is
   available too in the SmallEiffel directory, you just have to run it.

   On other systems, the very first step for installation is to C compile
   the install.c file in order to run it.

   Options

   -interactive:
          By default, the install command tries to determinate
          automatically the system name as well as the C compiler name.
          When the flag -interactive is used, the user is interactively
          prompted for the system name and the C compiler to select as
          well as some other crucial informations. When all the
          information has been interactively gathered, the command
          prompts for confirmation before starting the remainder of the
          installation process automatically. Using first the
          -interactive flag is a good idea to know more about supported
          system list as well as supported C compiler list.
   -debug:
          Displays a lot of information useful to debug the installation
          process. It is also interresting if you are curious to see what
          the install command is really doing (or trying to do ;) ).
   -cc <c_compiler>:
          By default, install interactively asks for the C compiler to
          use. With this option specified, is skips this query and uses
          the c_compiler name. This c_compiler name must be one of the
          supported C compilers (e.g. gcc). This is mostly useful for
          system-specific installation scripts that execute install as
          part of it.
   -skip_c_compilation:
          Assumes that all commands are already compiled and their
          executables exist. This is useful only for binary
          distributions.
