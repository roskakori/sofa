                            The install command

   Usage

   install [-interactive] [-debug]

   Command install is the installation program for SmallEiffel The GNU
   Eiffel Compiler.
   This command (class install.e) is entirely written in Eiffel and is
   the recommanded one to install SmallEiffel The GNU Eiffel Compiler.

   The install.e source code as well as the generated C code install.c
   are in the SmallEiffel directory.

   If you are under some UNIX (including GNU Linux) system and if you
   want to use the gcc compiler like we do, simply type make in the
   SmallEiffel directory (the Makefile which is in the SmallEiffel
   directory C-compile and launch automatically the install command).

   If you are using a Windows system, a precompiled install.exe is
   available too in the SmallEiffel directory, you just have to run it.

   On other systems, the very first step for installation is to C compile
   the install.c file in order to run it.

   Options

   -interactive:
          By default, the install command tries to determinate
          automatically the system name as well as the C compiler name.
          When the flag -interactive is used, the user is interactively
          prompted for the system name and the C compiler to select.
   -debug:
          Displays a lot of information useful to debug the installation
          process. It is also interresting if you are curious to see what
          the install command is really doing (or trying to do ;) ).
