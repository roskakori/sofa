   install

   The installation program for SmallEiffel [1]More about install here.

   compile

   Starting from an Eiffel source program, generates the corresponding C
   code and then the executable. This is probably the command you want to
   use. [2]More about compile here.

   compile_to_c

   The Eiffel to C compiler itself. You do not generally invoke it
   explicitely. [3]More about compile_to_c here.

   compile_to_jvm

   The Eiffel to Java bytecode compiler. Starting from an Eiffel source
   program, generates the corresponding .class files. [4]More about
   compile_to_jvm here.

   short

   Eiffel interface extraction tool. Can generate documentation using
   different formats (ASCII, HTML, etc.) [5]More about short here.

   pretty

   Eiffel pretty printer. [6]More about pretty here.

   finder

   Used to find Eiffel source files according to the system
   configuration. [7]More about finder here.

   clean

   Used to clean Eiffel project directories. [8]More about clean here.

   print_jvm_class

   Java bytecode disassembler and pretty printer. We find it more
   convenient than javap. [9]More about print_jvm_class here.
