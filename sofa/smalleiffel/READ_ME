2 - Brief Description of SmallEiffel -

It is intended to be a complete, though small and very fast, 
free Eiffel compiler. It is available for a very wide range 
of platforms: UNIX (Linux, BSD, HP-UX, IRIX, XENIX, Solaris...), 
DOS, OS2, WINDOWS NT/95, Macintosh, NeXT, Amiga and VMS. 
 In fact, SmallEiffel should run on any platform for which 
an ANSI C - POSIX compiler exists.

The current distribution includes an Eiffel to C compiler, an Eiffel 
to Java bytecode compiler, a documentation tool, a
pretty printer and various other tools. 

SmallEiffel is the result of a research project of the LORIA, a join
computer science research center in Nancy, France.
It has been developed by Dominique Colnet, of the ECOO team. 

This project began in 1994, and since the very first public release 
in September 1995, SmallEiffel has been used worldwide by increasingly 
numerous individuals and Universities.

4 - Bug Reports -
Thank in advance for bug reports. Don't forget to have a look
first in the misc/NOT_YET_IMPLEMENTED.txt file.
Please, try to isolate the bug as much as possible.
The best is to be able to create a single file, as small a
possible (which includes the bug).
