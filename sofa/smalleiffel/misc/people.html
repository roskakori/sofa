<P>
The SmallEiffel Team is an informal group of people in the
<A HREF="http://www.loria.fr">LORIA</A> lab of Nancy, France,
gathered around the development of new compilation techniques
for object-oriented languages and their implementation in
SmallEiffel, The GNU Eiffel compiler.
Most of us are members of the
<A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/equipes/ecoo">ECOO research team</A>
of the LORIA.

Professor at the University Henri Poincaré of Nancy.

<P>
Dominique COLNET is the one who initiated the SmallEiffel project
in Summer 1994. His goal was to create an inexpensive, bug-free
advanced Eiffel compiler, unlike those already available on the market.<BR>
He has been the leader of this project as well as its key designer and
implementator since then.
(See the <A HREF="HISTORY.html">history page</A> for more information
on the chronology of the SmallEiffel project).<BR><BR>

Suzanne COLLIN has been working with Dominique from the very beginning,
taking a major part in conceptual and design discussions and decisions. <BR>
Not being a member of the ECOO research team, she also provided the
invaluable point of view of a user of object-oriented languages working in
the field of image processing and augmented reality.<BR><BR>

Working on a PhD about the compilation of OO languages
</DL>
<P>
He started working during most of his spare time with Dominique
on SmallEiffel in late 1994 - early 1995. He had many conceptual
and technical discussions with Dominique about languages,
anchored types, ANSI C, garbage collection, etc. and participated
to the first bootstrap. He also maintains the SmallEiffel Web site.
He was able to join the ECOO research team in late 1997 and
thus is now working almost full-time on SmallEiffel.

After being a student of Dominique, and in charge of the Macintosh-ready
versions of SmallEiffel during his free-time since 1996, Philippe joined the
SmallEiffel team of the ECOO research team between February and September 1998
for his  Master thesis. He worked more especially on the garbage collector.

<P>
Many people have contributed to SmallEiffel, The GNU Eiffel
Compiler. </P>
<P>
The first of them, in chronological order, are the computer science
students of the University Henri Poincaré of Nancy, France. They tested and
benchmarked it, providing very useful information in the early days of
SmallEiffel.</P>
<P>
Then, many people, either working in computer engineering or computer science, or
simply users working in various academic and business fields, took part in the
process of improving SmallEiffel. Since it became The GNU Eiffel Compiler, in
early 1998, even more people are helping its development.
</P>
<P>
We want to thanks all these people who help us in this great adventure.
Althought it is not possible to mention them all, here is a
short <A HREF="THANKS.html">list of the most important contributors</A>.
