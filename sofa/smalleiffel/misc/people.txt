   The SmallEiffel Team

   The SmallEiffel Team is an informal group of people in the [1]LORIA
   lab of Nancy, France, gathered around the development of new
   compilation techniques for object-oriented languages and their
   implementation in SmallEiffel, The GNU Eiffel compiler. Most of us are
   members of the [2]ECOO research team of the LORIA.

   [o]
   Dominique COLNET
          Professor at the University Henri Poincaré of Nancy.

   Dominique COLNET is the one who initiated the SmallEiffel project in
   Summer 1994. His goal was to create an inexpensive, bug-free advanced
   Eiffel compiler, unlike those already available on the market.
   He has been the leader of this project as well as its key designer and
   implementator since then. (See the [3]history page for more
   information on the chronology of the SmallEiffel project).
   [o]
   Suzanne COLLIN
          Assistant Professor at the University Henri Poincaré of Nancy.

   Suzanne COLLIN has been working with Dominique from the very
   beginning, taking a major part in conceptual and design discussions
   and decisions.
   Not being a member of the ECOO research team, she also provided the
   invaluable point of view of a user of object-oriented languages
   working in the field of image processing and augmented reality.

   Olivier ZENDRA
          Working on a PhD about the compilation of OO languages

   He started working during most of his spare time with Dominique on
   SmallEiffel in late 1994 - early 1995. He had many conceptual and
   technical discussions with Dominique about languages, anchored types,
   ANSI C, garbage collection, etc. and participated to the first
   bootstrap. He also maintains the SmallEiffel Web site. He was able to
   join the ECOO research team in late 1997 and thus is now working
   almost full-time on SmallEiffel.

   Former but still active team members

   [o]
   Philippe COUCAUD
          Master Thesis about garbage collection in OO languages.
          Currently working in industry.

   After being a student of Dominique, and in charge of the
   Macintosh-ready versions of SmallEiffel during his free-time since
   1996, Philippe joined the SmallEiffel team of the ECOO research team
   between February and September 1998 for his Master thesis. He worked
   more especially on the garbage collector.

   Other contributors

   Many people have contributed to SmallEiffel, The GNU Eiffel Compiler.

   The first of them, in chronological order, are the computer science
   students of the University Henri Poincaré of Nancy, France. They
   tested and benchmarked it, providing very useful information in the
   early days of SmallEiffel.

   Then, many people, either working in computer engineering or computer
   science, or simply users working in various academic and business
   fields, took part in the process of improving SmallEiffel. Since it
   became The GNU Eiffel Compiler, in early 1998, even more people are
   helping its development.

   We want to thanks all these people who help us in this great
   adventure. Althought it is not possible to mention them all, here is a
   short [4]list of the most important contributors.
