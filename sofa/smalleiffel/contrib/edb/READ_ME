-- How to install
1. Place edb.el or edb19.el under the emacs load-path directory. Byte
compiling is recommended.
  Insert autoload command into your .emacs

 (autoload 'edb "edb" nil t)

2. Place 3 perl scripts on your favarite directory. chmod +x them.
   These scripts assumes perl is installed at /usr/local/bin.  If the
location is different,
   rewrite header comment of these scripts.
3. If you want to use Boehm's gc library, place gc-inc at /usr/local/include.

   The gc library is assumed to be installed under /usr/local.
