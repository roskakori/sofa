<p>Essentially, this means that you can freely redistribute the

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>

<li>A C compiler. Currently, SAS/c is the only one which is known to
work. GCC should, but is rarely tested. Others will be supported in
later releases (eg. VBCC).</li>

<li>About 16 MB RAM and 20 MB hard-disk space. More is better, less
might work but don't count on it. Because the SmallEiffel (SE)
compiler doesn't yet handle out of memory errors, watch your Workbench
title bar if you are short of RAM. (This SE-bug has already been
reported and is probably fixed in later releases.)</li>

</ul>


<h2>Installation</h2>

Use the installer script. This already fills all the cryptic setup
files of SE with reasonable values, so unless you need an ego rush,
don't perform a manual installation.

<h2>First Steps</h2>

<p>Once Sofa is installed and you have rebooted (to enable the new
Workbench search path), open a CLI window.</p>

<p>If you use SAS/c, you have to provide a <tt>SCOPTIONS</tt> file that
has been prepared for use with SE. Simply type</p>

<pre>
copy sofa:settings/sofa.with SCOPTIONS
</pre>

After that, start your editor and create a file <tt>hello.e</tt> with the
following content:

<pre>
class HELLO

creation make

feature
   make is
   do
      print("hello.%N")
   end

end -- class HELLO
</pre>

<p>To compile it, type</p>

<pre>
compile hello
</pre>

<p>Then you might have to wait for quite some while. Eventually, you
should end up with a program <tt>hello</tt> that when invoked displays
the text "<tt>hello.</tt>".</p>

<p>If not, request support (see below).</p>

<p>If so, congratulations, you just created a debugging version of
<tt>hello</tt>. To get rid of all the junk files the compiler created,
type</p>

<pre>
clean hello
</pre>

<p>To create an optimised version without the garbage collector (GC),
type</p>

<pre>
compile -boost -no_gc hello
</pre>

<p>This reduces the size of the executable from about 50K to about
14K, which should be quite acceptable. I mention this just because
early Eiffel compilers created 2MB <tt>hello</tt> programs, and some
people still have this misconception in their mind.</p>

<p>You can find some more examples in the
<tt>sofa:SmallEiffel/lib_show</tt> directory. If you are new to Eiffel
in general, take a look at <a
href="http://elj.com/eiffel/getting-started/">http://elj.com/eiffel/getting-started/</a>.
On the same site, you can find loads of other material, Eiffel news and pointers
to more information.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>All tools and libraries have documentation which mentions where to obtain
support for the specific item.</p>

<p>In future, there will be a Sofa mailing list to discuss problems
related to this particular distribution only, like installation or
using Amiga specific features.</p>

<p>For the time being, you can post Amiga specific questions to <a
href="news:comp.sys.amiga.programmer">comp.sys.amiga.programmer</a>
and Eiffel related questions to <a
href="news:comp.lang.eiffel">comp.lang.eiffel</a>. For the time being,
you can submit corrections and bug-fixes to Thomas Aglassinger
&lt;agi@sbox.tu-graz.ac.at&gt;. But this will change once the mailing
list is up.</p>

Thomas.
