DEVELOPER MATERIAL

	The material collected here is not needed to develop applications
	with Sofa. It is only helpful if you want to contribute to Sofa
	yourself.


REQUIREMENTS

	Some of the scripts require certain assigns and directories to exist:

		sofa:archive      - where created archives like "gobo.lha" end up
		sofa_archive:     - where original archives like "gobo15.zip" are stored
		release:          - where sofa.(lha|readme) end up
		release:backup/   - where sofa_XY.lha ends up
								  (X=version, Y=release)

	Open some CLI, create the directories wherever you want, and add
	appropriate assigns to your user-startup.

	ARexx must be running.


CONTENTS

	script/  - Various scripts and their support files
	rebuild/ - Material needed to rebuild optimized SmallEiffel with SAS/c

	Note that "sofa:Readme" is generated automatically by
	"script/make_sofa.rexx". If you want to change its content, you
	have to modify "script/readme.#?" or the script itself.
