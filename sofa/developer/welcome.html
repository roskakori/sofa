<h1>Developer Material</h1>


<p>The developer material not needed to develop applications with
Sofa. It is only helpful if you want to contribute to Sofa
yourself.</p>


<h2>Requirements</h2>

   Some of the scripts require certain assigns and directories to exist:

<ul>
<li>sofa:archive      - where created archives like "gobo.lha" end up

<li>sofa_archive:     - where original archives like "gobo15.zip" are stored

<li>release:          - where sofa.(lha|readme) end up

<li>release:backup/   - where <tt>sofa_XY.lha</tt> ends up (X=version, Y=release)

</ul>

<p>Open some CLI, create the directories wherever you want, and add
appropriate assigns to your user-startup.</p>

<p>ARexx must be installed.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>

<ul>

<li>script/  - Various scripts and their support files

<li>rebuild/ - Material needed to rebuild optimized SmallEiffel with
SAS/c

</ul>

<p>Note that "sofa:Readme" is generated automatically by
"script/make_sofa.rexx". If you want to change its content, you have
to modify "script/readme.#?" or the script itself.</p>
