<h1>Make_export_header</h1>


<h2>Version</h2>

1.0

<h2>Description</h2>

	<p>Make_export_header scans C source files (*.c) for prototypes and
	variables to be exported, and creates a C header file (*.h)
	declaring them. This header file can then be included by other C
	files that want to use the exported routines or variables.</p>

<h2>Author</h2>

	Thomas Aglassinger &lt;agi@sbox.tu-graz.ac.at&gt;

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>

<li>does not write header if existing header is identical, and
consequently does not spoil dependencies and enforce a recompile of
all modules that include the header

<li>supports declarations going over multiple line (uses "{", "=" or
";" to detect the end)

<li>number of declarations and length of identifiers is only limited
by available memory

<li>source code included

<li>portable and fast, because coded in Eiffel

</ul>

<h2>Template</h2>

<kbd>make_export_header target.h source1.c source2.c ...</kbd>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>In the C source, you have to mark declarations of functions and
variables to be exported with the pseudo-keyword "export". Because
such a keyword does not exist, you have to define an empty macro
before you can use it in the source. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
#define export /* empty */<br>
<br>
/* a variable to be exported */<br>
export char * hugo = "some text";<br>
<br>
/* a function to be exported */<br>
export int sepp(int resi, char * susi)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
}<br>
</blockquote>

<p>If this is stored in a source file "sepp.c", you can call</p>

<blockquote><kbd>make_export_header export_sepp.h sepp.c</kbd></blockquote>

<p>Essentially, "export_sepp.h" will contain:</p>

<blockquote>
extern char * hugo;<br>
int sepp(int resi, char * susi);
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, there is the usual <tt>#ifdef EXPORT_SEPP_H ...</tt> so that
you can include "export_sepp.h" multiple times without causing
problems. Finally, there is a little comment telling you not to modify
this file because it is generated automatically.</p>

<p>Probably you want a single header file for all exported symbols in
a project. For that, just specify the names of all the sources, for
instance:</p>

<blockquote><kbd>make_export_header export_sepp.h sepp.c hugo.c resi.c susi.c ...</kbd></blockquote>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>

<li>doesn't really parse the C code; It just looks for the "export"
keyword, and checks for terminating character. It is probably easy to
confuse with nested comments or too much macros magic.

<li>structs and #define's cannot be exported; they need to be put into
a separate header file

</ul>

<h2>Bugs</h2>

<ul>

<li>does not detect read/write errors (because compiled with SmallEiffel)

<li>crashes if it runs out of memory (because compiled with SmallEiffel)

<li>status output cannot be suppressed

<li>"export" keyword cannot be redefined (to for example "Prototype")

<li>comments in prototypes might confuse it, if they contain the word
	  "export" (Comments in other places are treated properly).

</ul>
