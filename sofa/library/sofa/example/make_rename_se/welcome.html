<h1>Make_rename_se</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>

Create "rename.se" by examining the classes stored in a ZIP file.


<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>All file systems have a limited length for filenames. Descriptive
Eiffel class names often exceed such limits. For that, SmallEiffel
allows to provide a file "rename.se", in which every line contains the
real (short) name of the file for a certain class. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
yy_compressed_scanner_skeleton.e yy_compressed_scanner_skelet.e<br>
yy_interactive_scanner_skeleton.e yy_interactive_scanner_skele.e
</blockquote>

   The only bad thing about that: somebody has to create the
   "rename.se", which is very boring. Fortunately, this tool does it
   automatically.


<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>`Make_rename_se' assumes that you have a ZIP archive, where the
classes are stored with their long names. Furthermore, `unzip'
available from the Info-ZIP homepage must be within the search
path.</p>

<p>Both `make_rename_se' and `unzip' should work on all systems
supported by SmallEiffel. However, output redirection has to be
supported by the OS.</p>


<h2>Compiling</h2>

<p>As this is a developer tool without any use for sensible human
beings, you have to compile it yourself. Simply type</p>

<blockquote><kbd>compile -boost -clean make_rename_se</kbd></blockquote>

<p>This should create an optimized version.</p>


<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Possible command line options are:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>archive.zip</i>   - path of the ZIP archive containing the classes
<li><kbd>length</kbd> <i>number</i> - maximum length of filenames (&gt;2)
<li><kbd>amiga</kbd>           - same as "length 30"
<li><kbd>mac</kbd>             -  same as "length 31"
<li><kbd>dos</kbd>             - same as "length 10"
<li><kbd>quiet</kbd>           - act quietly
</ul>

<p>Order and case of option names don't matter. And no silly "-",
"--" or "/" prefix is needed.</p>

<p>If you don't specify a length, an internal default with a
ridiculously low value is used, which guarantees pretty useless
filenames. So you better specify one.</p>


<h2>Example</h2>

   <p>Usage is simple. All you have to know is the name of the ZIP
   archive and the maximum length of filenames on your system.</p>

   <p>Here is an example on how to create "rename.se" files for the
   popular Gobo library under AmigaOS.</p>

   <ol>

   <li>Create a directory to avoid clutter

      <blockquote><kbd>makedir gobo<br>
      cd gobo</kbd></blockquote>

   <li>Download the ZIP archive containing Gobo and copy it to the
      current directory. After that, you should have a file called
      "gobo15.zip" (or something similar, depending on the current
      version).

   <li>Extract the archive, ignoring the fact that some filenames will
      be cut

      <blockquote><kbd>unzip gobo15.zip</kbd></blockquote>

      Now the directory tree of gobo has been created. Furthermore,
      you can be sure that `unzip' is in the search path.
      If it didn't work out, get `unzip' as mentioned above.

   <li>Figure out the maximum length of filenames for Eiffel classes:

      <ul>
      <li>AmigaOS: 30
      <li>MacOS:   31
      <li>MS-DOS:  10 (because two characters are unused in the extension)
      </ul>

   <li>Start `make_rename_se':

         <blockquote><kbd>make_rename_se length 30 gobo15.zip</kbd></blockquote>

      Alternatively, you could also have typed

         <blockquote><kbd>make_rename_se amiga gobo15.zip</kbd></blockquote>

   </ol>

      <p>After pressing RETURN, you see what is going on. Basically, the
      tool first creates a listing of the ZIP file contents to find
      out the real, possibly too long, names of the classes. It then
      analyzes directories in the archive and generates unique short
      names for every class. By doing that it ensures that every file
      gets a ".e" suffix and does not have the same name as another
      class in the same directory (which could easily happen if it
      would just cut the name).</p>

      <p>After that, it extracts all classes with too long names and
      renames them to the unique short name. While doing that, it also
      generates the "rename.se" for every directory where files had to
      be renamed.</p>

      <p>The output should look something like this:</p>

<pre>
         unzip -l &gt;t:make_rename_se.tmp "sofa_archive:gobo15.zip"
         read archive list
         analyze
            src/geyacc/
            library/structure/sort/
            library/structure/list/
            library/structure/base/
            library/parse/yacc/
         ...
         rename library/kernel/spec/ve/
            kl_imported_fixed_array_rout.e &lt;- kl_imported_fixed_array_routines.e
            kl_imported_string_buffer_ro.e &lt;- kl_imported_string_buffer_routines.e
            kl_imported_output_stream_ro.e &lt;- kl_imported_output_stream_routines.e
            kl_imported_input_stream_rou.e &lt;- kl_imported_input_stream_routines.e
            kl_imported_fixed_array_type.e
         rename library/kernel/spec/se/
            kl_imported_fixed_array_rout.e &lt;- kl_imported_fixed_array_routines.e
            kl_imported_string_buffer_ro.e &lt;- kl_imported_string_buffer_routines.e
            kl_imported_output_stream_ro.e &lt;- kl_imported_output_stream_routines.e
            kl_imported_input_stream_rou.e &lt;- kl_imported_input_stream_routines.e
            kl_imported_fixed_array_type.e
         ...
</pre>

      <p>Only classes with filenames longer than 30 characters are
      extracted from the ZIP archive and renamed.</p>

      <p>Classes with exactly 30 characters are just extracted, for
      example "kl_imported_fixed_array_type.e ". This is to make sure
      that they didn't get lost during the renaming and extracting of
      all the other classes. Without going too much into detail, file
      systems behave differently when having to deal with too long
      names, and this avoids all sorts of trouble.</p>

      <p>If a directory contains many ".e" files, but all of them have
      names shorter or equal than 30 characters, no "rename.se" is
      created.</p>


<h2>Problems</h2>

   <ul>

   <li>If you can't run `make_rename_se' on the target OS, you can do the
   job on a different OS. For example, nobody prevents you from invoking

      <blockquote><kbd>make_rename_se dos gobo15.zip</kbd></blockquote>

   on a Unix box.

   <li>The syntax "length=30" is not supported. Use "length 30" instead.

   <li>All other files like documentation and executables are not
   considered by "make_rename_se", so if they have too long filenames,
   you have to do something else about them.

   <li>Only ZIP archives are supported. This makes sense as the Info-ZIP
   tools are Open Source and have been ported to almost all systems
   still in use - and even seem to work on all of them (different to
   for instance "tar.gz" and ".lha", which usually come with a huge
   pile of idiosyncracies and implementation problems).
